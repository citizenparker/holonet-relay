ATTENTION

An outbreak of the deadly plague Brainrot has overtaken the planet Hoth. It is believed to have started when a group of Rebels released an unused biological weapon left by the Confederacy.

All travel to Hoth has been suspended and an Imperial Fleet is safeguarding the planet until further notice.

Visitors to the Outer Rim!

Reports of unfortunate incidents from civilians traveling to the Galactic North and Northwestern parts of the galaxy have risen in recent months. While the Outer Rim can be a fun and exhilarating place to visit, please keep a few safety precautions in mind when traveling:

* Stick to the known hyperspace lanes. While nebulas, uncolonized worlds, and other natural phenomena can be a breathtaking sight to behold, they are often prime hiding spots for pirates (or worse, rebels).
* If you are traveling to see some of the flora and fauna of the outer rim, be sure to take an experienced guide with you. We’ve seen a number of run-ins with local wildlife on exotic planets lately - do not underestimate a savage beauty!
* Rumor and speculation run wild in the Outer Rim. Tales of vast, lost treasures are just as common as the travelers who are taken in by them. Remember: Anything that sounds too good to be true probably is and should be reported to the local Imperial Field Office.

The Nilgaard, Colindra, Pakuuni, and Chorlian sectors are fantastic places to visit and are extremely tourist-friendly despite the warnings above. For your safety, we encourage visitors to travel and to check in with their local Imperial Civilian Assistance Bureau during their travels.

We’re here to help. Be seeing you!

# HolonetRelay

A simple little app to create a read-only make-believe USENET-like mail reader in the world of Star Wars circa 3 ABY. Intended for use by over-obsessive Star Wars RPG GMs like myself.

## Running

To start:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.start`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

## Deploying to Heroku

```
> heroku apps:create YOURNAMEHERE
> heroku stack:set cedar
> heroku config:set MIX_ENV=prod BUILDPACK_URL="https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git"
> git push heroku master
```

## Adding new messages

The mail reader divides messages as follows:
* The mail reader has two top-level folders: the Inbox (located at `PROJECT_ROOT/inbox`) and the Archive (located at `PROJECT_ROOT/archive`)
* Within a folder, messages are divided into **groups** which are subdirectories within the folder. So for instance, if you wanted the Relay to receive a message in the `rec.arts.twilek-dancing` group in the Inbox, you'd create a folder `inbox/rec.arts.twilek-dancing/`
* Individual messages are just Markdown folders within a group folder. There will eventually be a somewhat special syntax for them, but for now the only requirement is that the message has `subject: SOME TEXT HERE` somewhere within it. So to create a message called "Mon Calamari Dancing is WHERE IT IS AT" in the aforementioned group, make a markdown file at `inbox/rec.arts.twilek-dancing/mon-calamari-dancing.md` that contains somewhere within the file the line `subject: Mon Calamari Dancing is WHERE IT IS AT`
